1. A familiar expoſition of Michael Cope vpon the Prouerbes of Solomon.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The ſecond Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The thirde Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The fourth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The fifth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

    _ The ſixth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The ſeuenth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The viii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

    _ The nienth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ ☞ THE PROVERBES OF SOLOMON.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The eleuenth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The twelfth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xiii, Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xiiii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The fifteenth Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xvi. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xvii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xviii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xix. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xx. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxi. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxiii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxiiii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxv. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxvi. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxvii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxviii. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 19A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoule: but it is an abhomination to fooles to depart from euill.

      * 20He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhalbe wiſe: but a companion of fooles ſhalbe afflicted.

      * 21Al affliction foloweth ſinners, but vnto the righteous God wil recompence good.

      * 22The good man ſhal giue inheritance vnto his childrēs children: & the riches of the ſinner is layde vp for the iuſt.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 25The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the bellie of the wicked ſhal want.

      * 1 A Wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: but the fooliſh deſtroieth it with her owne handes.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxix. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 2Hee that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, feareth the Lorde: but hee that is lewde in his wayes, deſpiſeth him.

      * 3In the mouth of the fooliſh, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wiſe preſerue them.

      * 4Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is emptie: but muche increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the Oxe.

      * 5A faithfull witneſſe will not lie: but a falſe recorde will ſpeake lyes.

      * 6A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not: but knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtande.

      * 7Depart from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt not in him the lips of knowledge.

      * 8The wiſdome of the prudent is to vnderſtand his way: but the fooliſhnes of fooles is deceite.

      * 10The heart knoweth the bitternes of his ſoule, and the ſtranger ſhal not medle with his ioye.

      * 11The houſe of the wicked ſhalbe deſtroyed: but the tabernacle of the righteous, ſhal floriſh.

      * 12There is a way which ſeemeth right to a man: but the yſſues thereof are the wayes of death.

      * 13Euen in laughing the heart is ſorowful, and the ende of that mirth, is heauines.

      * 14The hearte that declineth, ſhalbee ſatiate with his owne wayes: but a good man ſhall rule ouer him.

      * 16A wiſe man feareth and departeth from euill: but a foole rageth and is careleſſe.

      * 17He that is haſtie to anger, committeth follie, and a buſie bodie is hated.

      * 18The fooliſh do inherite follie: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 25A faythful witneſſe deliuereth ſoules: but a deceiue• ſpeaketh lyes.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 32The wicked ſhall bee caſt away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

      * 33Wiſedome reſteth in the heart of him that hath vnderſtanding, and is knowne in the middes of fooles.

      * 34Iuſtice exalteth a nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the people.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxx. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 35The pleaſure of a king is in a wiſe ſeruant: but his wrath ſhalbe towarde him that is lewde.

      * 1A ſofte anſwere putteth away wrath: but greeuo•• woordes ſtirre vp anger.

      * 2The tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out fooliſhneſſe.

      * 3The eyes of the Lord in euery place, beholde the euil and the good.

      * 4A whole ſome tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardneſſe thereof is the breaking of the minde.

      * 5A foole deſpiſeth his fathers inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, is prudent.

      * 6The houſe of the righteous hath muche treaſure: but in the reuenewes of the wicked there is trouble.

      * 7The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroade knowledge: but the hart of the fooliſh doeth not ſo.

      * 8The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lorde: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.

      * 9The way of the wicked is abhomination vnto the Lorde: but hee loueth him that followeth righteouſneſſe.

      * 10Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that hateth correction, ſhall die.

      * 11Hell and deſtruction are before the Lorde: howe muche more the heartes of the ſonnes of men?

      * 12A ſcorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither wil he goe vnto the wiſe.

      * 13A ioyful heart maketh a chearful countenance: but by the ſorow of the heart the minde is heauie.

      * 14The hart of him that hath vnderſtanding, ſeeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fed with fooliſhneſſe.

      * 15All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.

      * 16Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure, and trouble therewith.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.

    _ The xxxi. Chapter.

      * 1THe parables of Solomon the Sonne of Dauid king of Iſrael.2To know wiſedome & inſtruction, to vnderſtande the wordes of knowledge.3To receiue inſtruction to doe wiſely by iuſtice and iudgement and equitie.

      * 4To giue vnto the ſimple ſharpnes of witte, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion.

      * 5A wiſe man ſhall heare and encreaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhal attaine vnto wiſe counſels.6To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation, the worde: of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.

      * 7The feare of the Lorde is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles haue deſpiſed wiſedome and inſtruction.

      * 8.My Sonne, heare thy Fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy Mothers teaching.9For they ſhalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaynes for thy necke.

      * 10My Sonne, if ſinners do intice thee, conſent thou not.11If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe:12VVe wil ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as thoſe that go downe to the pit:13ƲƲe ſhal finde all precious riches, and fil our houſes with ſpoyle:14Caſt in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purſe.15My ſonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.16For their feete runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhedde blood.17Certainely as without cauſe the net is ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wyng:18So they lay wait for bloud & lie priuilie for their liues.19Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.

      * 20VViſedome crieth without, ſhe vttereth her voyce in the ſtreetes.21She calleth in the high ſtreete among the preaſe in the entringes of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the Citie, ſaying:22O yee fooliſhe, howe long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe? and the ſcornefull take their pleaſure in ſcorning; and the fooles hate knowledge?

      * 23Turne you at my correction: loe, I will poure out my mynde vnto you, and make you vnderſtande my wordes.

      * 24Becauſe I haue called, & ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out mine hand, and none would regard:25But ye haue despiſed all my counſel, and would none of my correction:26I wil alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.27VVhen your feare commeth lyke ſuddaine deſolation, and your deſtruction ſhal come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguiſh ſhal come vpon you:28Then ſhall they call vppon mee, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.

      * 29Bycauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde.30They would none of my counſel, but despiſed all my correction.31Therfore ſhal they eate of the fruite of their own way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes.

      * 32For eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh, and the prosperity of fooles deſtroyeth them.33But he that obeyeth me, ſhal dwel ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euil.

      * 1MY ſonne, if thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee,2And cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and encline thine heart to vnderſtanding.3For if thou calleſt after knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding:4If thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer, and ſearcheſt for her, as for treaſures:5Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand the feare of the Lorde, and finde the knowledge of God.6For the Lorde giueth wiſedome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding.

      * 7He preſerueth the ſtate of the righteous: he is a ſheelde to them that walke vprightly.8That they may keep the wayes of iudgement: & he preſerueth the way of his ſaints.

      * 10VVhen VViſedome entreth into thine heart, & knowledge delighteth thy ſoule,11Then ſhal counſel preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhal keepe thee,12And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things:13And from them that leaue the wayes of righteouſnes to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe:14VVhich reioyce in doing euil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked,15VVhoſe wayes are crooked, and they are leude in their pathes.

      * 16And it ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, euen frō the ſtranger, which flattereth with her words.17VVhich for ſaketh the guide of her youth, & forgeteth the couenant of her God.18Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes vnto the dead.19Al they that goe vnto her, returne not againe; neither take they hold of the waies of life.

      * 20Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, & keepe the waies of the righteous.21For the iuſt ſhall dwell in the land, & the vpright men ſhall remaine in it.22But the wicked ſhalbe cut of from the earth, and the tranſgreſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it.

      * 1MY ſonne, forget not thou my lawe, but let thine hear• keepe my commandements.2For they ſhall increaſe the length of thy dayes, and the yeeres of life and thy proſperitie.

      * 3Let not mercy & truth forſake thee: binde them on thy neck, & write them vpon the table of thine hart.4So ſhalt thou finde fauour & good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God and man.

      * 5Truſt in the Lord with al thine hart, & leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome.6In al thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhal direct thy wayes.

      * 7Be not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.

      * 9Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the firſt fruites of all thine increaſe.10So ſhal thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhal burſt with newe VVine.

      * 11My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neyther be grieued with his correction.12For the Lorde correcteth him, whom he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whome he delighteth.

      * 13Bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſedome, & the man that getteth vnderſtanding.14For the merchandize thereof, is better than the merchandize of ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is better than gold.15It is more precious than pearles: and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto her.16Length of dayes is in her right hande, and in her left hand, riches and glory.17Her wayes are wayes of pleaſure, and all her pathes proſperitie.18She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and bleſſed is he that reteineth her.

      * 19The Lord by VViſedome hath laide the foundation of the earth, and hath ſtabliſhed the heauens through vnderſtanding.20By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe the dewe.21My Sonne, let not theſe things depart from thine eies, but obſerue VViſdome and counſell.22So they ſhalbe life vnto thy ſoule, and grace vnto thy necke.

      * 23Then ſhalt thou walke ſafely by thy way: and thy foote ſhal not ſtumble.Pſal. 91. ••.24If thou ſleepeſt, thou ſhalt not bee afraide, and when thou ſleepeſt, thy ſleepe ſhalbe ſweete.

      * 25Thou ſhalt not feare for any ſodaine feare, neither for the deſtruction of the wicked, when it cometh.26For the Lorde ſhalbe for thine aſſurance, & ſhall preſerue thy foote from taking.

      * 27Withhold not the good from the owners therof: though there be power in thine hand to doe it.

      * 28Say not vnto thy neighbour, goe and come againe, a•• to morowe wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.

      * 29Intende none hurt againſt thy neighbour, ſeing he doth dwel without feare by thee.

      * 30Striue not with a man cauſeles, when hee hath doon• thee no harme.

      * 31Be not enuious for the wicked man, neither chooſe any of his wayes.32For the frowarde is abhomination vnto the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.

      * 33The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous.34With the skorneful he skorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.

      * 35The wiſe ſhal inherite glory: but fooles diſhonor, though they be exalted.

      * 1HEare, O ye children, the inſtruction of a father, & giue eare to learne vnderſtanding.2For I do giue you a good doctrine: therefore forſake yee not my lawe.

      * 3For I was my fathers Sonne, tender and deere in the ſight of my mother.4When hee taught mee, and ſaide vnto me, let thine hart holde faſt my wordes: keepe my commandementes, and thou ſhalt li•e.

      * 5Get wiſedome: get vnderſtanding: forget not neither decline from the wordes of my mouth.6Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhal keepe thee, loue her, & ſhee ſhal preſerue thee.

      * 7Wiſedome is the beginning: get wiſedom therfore: & aboue al thy poſſeſſion, get vnderſtanding.8Exalt her, and ſhe ſhal exa•t thee: ſhe ſhal bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.9Shee ſhal giue a comely ornament vnto thy head, yea, ſhee ſhal giue thee a Crowne of glorie.

      * 10Heare my Sonne, and receiue my wordes, & the yeeres of thy life ſhalbe many.

      * 11I haue taught thee in the way of VViſdome, and ledde thee in the pathes of righteouſnes:12VVhen thou goeſt, thy gate ſhal not be ſtraight, & whē thou runneſt, thou ſhalt not fall.13Take hold of inſtruction, and leaue her not: keepe her, for ſhee is thy life.

      * 14Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euil men.15Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and paſſe by.16For they can not ſleepe, except they haue done euil, and their ſleepe departeth, excepte they cauſe ſome to fall.17For they eate the bread of wickednes, and drinke tho wine of violence.

      * 18But the way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day.19The way of the wicked is as the darkeneſſe: they knowe not wherein they ſhal fall.

      * 20My ſonne, hearken vnto my words, encline thine eare vnto my ſayings.21Let them not depart from thine eies, but keepe them in the mids of thine heart.22For they are life vnto thoſe that finde them, & health vnto all their fleſh.

      * 23Keepe thine heart with al diligence: for thereout commeth life.

      * 24Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.

      * 25Let thine eyes behold the right, & let thine eye liddes direct thy way before thee.

      * 26Ponder the pathe of thy feete, and let al thy wayes be ordered aright.27Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left: but remooue thy foote from euil.

      * 1My Sonne, hearken vnto my wiſedome, & encline thine eare vnto my knowledge,2That thou mayeſt regard counſel, and thy lippes obſerue knowledge.

      * 3For the lippes of a ſtraunge woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is more ſoft then oyle.4But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged ſword.5Her feete goe downe to death, and her ſteppes take hold on hell.6Shee weigheth not the way of life: her pathes are moueable: thou canſt not knowe them.

      * 7Heare ye me now therfore, O children, and departe not from the wordes of my mouth.

      * 8Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her houſe:9Leſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and thy yeeres vnto the cruel:10Leſt the ſtranger ſhould be filled with thy ſtrength, and thy labors be in the houſe of a ſtranger,11And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bodie.)12And ſay, Howe haue I hated inſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed correction:13And haue not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine eare to thē that inſtructed me?14I was almoſt brought into al euil, in the midſt of the congregation, and aſſembly.

      * 15Drinke the water of thy Ceſterne, and of the Riuers out of the midſt of thine owne well.16Let thy Fountaine flowe foorth, and the Riuers of waters in the ſtreetes.17But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the ſtrangers with thee.

      * 18Let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.19Let her be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe: Let her breaſtes ſatisfie thee at all times.

      * 20For why ſhouldest thou delight, my ſonne, in a ſtrange woman, or imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?21For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.

      * 22His owne iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, & he ſhalbe holden with the cordes of his owne ſinne.23He ſhal die for fault of inſtruction, & ſhall goe aſtray through his great folly.

      * 1MY Sonne, if thou bee ſuretie for thy neighbour, and haſt ſtricken hands with the ſtranger:2Thou art ſnared with the words of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the words of thine owne mouth.3Doe this now, my ſonne, and deliuer thy ſelfe: ſeeing thou arte come into the hand of thy neighbor, goe & humble thy ſelfe, and ſolicite thy friendes.4Giue no ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye liddes.5Deliuer thy ſelfe, as a Doe from the hand of the hunter, & as the byrde from the hand of the fouler.

      * 6Go to the piſmire, o ſluggard: behold her waies, & be wiſe.7For ſhe hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler:8Prepareth her meate in the ſommer, and gathereth her foode in the harueſt.

      * 9Howe long wilt thou ſleepe, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleepe?10Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, a litle folding of the handes to ſleepe.11Therfore thy pouertie cometh on, as one that trauayleth by the way, & thy neceſſitie like an armed man.

      * 12The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a frowarde mouth.13He maketh a ſigne with his eyes, hee ſignifieth with his feete: he inſtructeth with his fingers:14Lewde thinges are in his hart hee imagineth euil at all times, and raiſeth vp contentions.15Therfore ſhal his deſtruction come ſpeedily: hee ſhalbe deſtroyed ſodainly without recouery.

      * 16Theſe ſixe thinges doeth the Lord hate: yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen:
17 The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that ſhed innocent blood,18An heart that ymagineth wicked enterpriſes, feete that be ſwift in running to miſchiefe,19A falſe witnes that ſpeaketh lies, & him that rayſeth vp contentions amongſt brethren.

      * 20My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not thy mothers inſtruction.21Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke.

      * 22It ſhall leade thee, when thou walkeſt: it ſhal watch for thee, when thou ſleepest: and when thou wakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee.

      * 23For the commaundement is a Lanterne, and inſtruction, a light: and corrections for inſtructions are the wayes of life.

      * 24To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from the flatterie of the tongue of a ſtrange woman.

      * 25Deſire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye liddes.26For becauſe of the whoriſh woman, a man is brought vnto a morſel of bread, & aor, the vvife of a man hunteth after the precious ſoule.woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.

      * 27Can a man take fire in his boſome, and not his clothes be burnt?28Or can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not bee burnt?29So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, ſhal not be innocent, whoſoeuer toucheth her.

      * 30Men doe not deſpiſe a thiefe, when he ſtealeth, to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe he is hungrie.31But if he be found, he ſhal reſtore ſeuen fold, or hee ſhall giue al the ſubſtance of his houſe.

      * 32But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, hee is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: he that doeth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.33He ſhal finde a wounde and diſhonour, and his reproche ſhal neuer be put away.34For iealouſie is the rage of a man: therefore hee wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance.35He can not beare the ſight of any ranſome: neither will he conſent, though thou augment the gifts.

      * 1My Sonne, keepe my wordes, and hide my Commaundements with thee.

      * 2Keepe my Commandements, and thou ſhalt liue; & mine inſtruction, as the apple of thine eye.3Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.

      * 4Say vnto wiſedome, Thou art my ſiſter: & cal vnderſtanding thy kinſwoman:5That they may keepe thee from the ſtrange woman, euen from the ſtranger that is ſmooth in her wordes.

      * 6As I was in the windowe of mine houſe, I looked through my windowe.7And I ſawe among the fooles, and conſidered amongeſt the children, a young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding.8Who paſſed through the ſtreete by her corner, & went toward her houſe,9In the twilight in the euening, when the night beganne to be blacke and darke.10And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes behauiour, and ſuttle in heart.11Shee is babling and loude: whoſe feete can not abide in her houſe.12Nowe ſhee is without, nowe in the ſtreetes, and lyeth in wayte at euery corner.13So ſhee caught him and kiſſed him, and with an impudent face ſaide vnto him,14I haue peace offeringes: this day haue I payde my vowes.15Therfore came I foorth to meet thee, that I might ſeeke thy face: and I haue found thee.16I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.17I haue perfumed my bedde with Myrrhe, Aloes, & Cynamon.18Come, let vs take our fil of loue, vntil the morning: let vs take our pleaſure in daliance.19For my husband is not at home: he is gon a iourney farre of.20He hath taken with him a bagge of ſiluer, and wil come home at the day appointed.21Thus with her great craft ſhe made him to yeelde: and with her flattering lippes ſhe intiſed him.22And he folowed her ſtraight wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foale to the flockes for correction.23Til a dart ſtricke through his liuer, as a byrd haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger.

      * 24Heare me nowe therefore, O children, and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.25Let not thine hearte decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her pathes.26For ſhee hath cauſed many to fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men are all ſlaine by her.27Her houſe is the way vnto the graue, which goeth down vnto the chambers of death.

      * 1DOth not wiſedome crie? and vnderſtanding vtter her voice?2She ſtandeth in the top of high places by the way in the place of the pathes.3She crieth beſides the gates before the citie at the entrie of the doores.4O men, I cal vnto you, and vtter my voice to the children of men.5O yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedome, and ye, O fooles, be wiſe in hearte.6Giue eare, for I wil ſpeake of excellent things, & the opening of my lippes ſhall teache thinges that be right.7For my mouth ſhal ſpeake the trueth, & my lippes abhorre wickedneſſe.8All the wordes of my mouth are righteous: there is no lewdneſſe, nor frowardneſſe in them.9They are al plaine to him that wil vnderſtand, & ſtraight to them that would vnderſtand.10Receiue mine inſtruction, and not ſiluer, and knowledge rather then fine golde.11For wiſedome is better then precious ſtones: and al pleaſures are not to be compared vnto her.12I wiſedome dwell with prudence, and I finde foorth knowledge and counſels.

      * 13The feare of the Lorde is to hate euill, as pride and arrogancie, and the euil way: and a mouth that ſpeaketh lewd things, I doe hate.14I haue counſel and wiſedome: I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.

      * 15By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.16By me Princes rule, and the nobles, and al the iudges of the earth.

      * 17I loue them that loue me: and they that ſeeke mee early, ſhal finde mee.18Riches and honour are with mee: euen durable riches and righteouſneſſe.19My frute is better then golde, euen then fine golde, and my reuenewes better then fine ſiluer.

      * 20I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the mids of the pathes of iudgement.21That I may cauſe them that loue mee, to inherite ſubſtance, and I wil fil their treaſures.

      * 22The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his workes of olde.23I was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth.24When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were no fountaines, abounding with water.25Before the mountaines were ſetled: and before the hils, was I begotten.26He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world.27When he prepared the heauens, I was there: when he ſet the compaſſe vpon the deepe,28When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when hee confirmed the fountaines of the deepe,29When hee gaue his decree to the ſea, that the waters ſhoulde not paſſe his commandements: when hee appointed the foundations of the earth,30Then was I with him as a nouriſher: and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him,31And tooke my ſolace in the compaſſe of his earth: and my delight is with the children of men.

      * 32Therfore now harken, O children, vnto mee: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes.33Heare inſtruction, and bee yee wiſe, and refuſe it not: bleſſed is the man that heareth mee, watching dayly at my gaies, and giuing attendance at the poſtes of my dores.34For he that findeth mee, findeth life, & ſhal obteine fauour of the Lorde:35But he that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule: and all that hate me, loue death.

      * 1WIſedome hath built her houſe, and heawen out her ſeuen pillers.2She hath killed her victuals, drawen her wine, and prepared her table.3She hath ſent foorth maidens, and cryeth vpon the higheſt places of the Citie ſaying,4Who ſo is ſimple let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith,5Come and eate of my meate, and drinke of the wyne that I haue drawne.

      * 6Forſake your way, ye fooliſh, & ye ſhal liue: & walke in the way of vnderſtanding.

      * 7Hee that reprooueth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame: and hee that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelfe a blotte.8Rebuke not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he wil loue thee.

      * 9Giue admonition to the wiſe, and he wil be the wiſer: teach a righteous man, & he wil increaſe in learning.

      * 10The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, is vnderſtanding.11For thy dayes ſhalbe multiplied by mee, and the yeares of thy life ſhalbe augmented.

      * 12If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, and if thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt ſuffer.

      * 13A fooliſh woman is troubleſome: ſhe is ignorant, and knoweth nothing.14But ſhe ſitteth at the dore of her houſe, on a ſeate in the high places of the citie:15To cal them that paſſe by the way, that go right on their way, ſaying:16Who ſo is ſimple, let him come hither: and to him that is deſtitute of wiſedome, ſhe ſaith alſo,17Stollen waters are ſweete, and hid bread is pleaſant.18But he knoweth not, that the dead are there, and that her gueſtes are in the depth of hel.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: but a fooliſh ſonne is an heauineſſe to his mother.

      * 2The treaſures of wickednes profit nothing: but righteouſnes deliuereth from death.

      * 3The Lorde will not famiſhe the ſoule of the righteous: but hee caſteth away the ſubſtacnce of the wicked.

      * 4A ſlouthful hande maketh poore: but the hande of the diligent maketh riche.

      * 5Hee that gathereth in Sommer, is the ſonne of wiſedome: but hee that ſleepeth in Harueſt, is the ſonne of confuſion.

      * 6Bleſſings are vpon the head of the righteous: but iniquitie ſhal couer the mouth of the wicked.

      * 7The memorial of the iuſt ſhalbe bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhal rotte.

      * 8The wiſe in heart wil receiue commandements: but the fooliſh in talke ſhalbe beaten.

      * 9He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly: but hee that peruerteth his wayes, ſhalbe knowne.

      * 10Hee that wincketh with the eye, worketh ſorow: and hee that is fooliſh in talke, ſhalbe beaten.

      * 11The mouth of the righteous is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hatred ſtirreth vp contentions: but loue couereth all treſpaſſes.

      * 13In the lippes of him that hath vnderſtanding, wiſedome is founde, and a rodde ſhalbe for the backe of him that is deſtitute of wiſedome.

      * 14Wiſe men laye vp knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is a preſent deſtruction.

      * 15The rich mans goods, are his ſtrong hold, but their owne pouertie feareth the poore.

      * 16The righteous laboureth to do good, but the vngodly vſeth his encreaſe vnto ſinne.

      * 17He that regardeth inſtruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuſeth correction, goeth out of the way of life.

      * 18He that doth diſſemble hatred, with lying lippes, & hee that inuenteth ſlaunder, is a foole.

      * 19In many wordes there cannot want iniquitie: but he that refraineth his lippes, is wiſe.

      * 20The tongue of the iuſt man, is fined ſiluer: but the harte of the vngodly is nothing woorth.

      * 21The lippes of the righteous feede a whole multitude: but fooles ſhal die for want of wiſedome.

      * 22The bleſſing of the Lord maketh riche men: and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it.

      * 23It is paſtime to a foole to do wickedly: but wiſdom is vnderſtanding to a man.

      * 24The thing that the vngodly are afraide of, ſhall come vppon them: but the righteous ſhall haue their deſire.

      * 25As the storme paſſeth, euen ſo ſhall the vngodly vaniſhe away: but the righteous, remaineth as a ſtrong foundation.

      * 26As vineger is vnto the teeth, & as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſlouthfull body vnto him that ſendeth him.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde encreaſeth the dayes: but the yeeres of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.

      * 28The patient abyding of the righteous ſhalbe gladneſſe: but the hope of the wicked ſhal periſh.

      * 29The way of the Lorde is ſtrong for him that is perfecte: but feare ſhalbe to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 30The righteous ſhal neuer bee remoued. but the wicked ſhal not remaine in the land.

      * 31The mouth of the righteous ſhal bring foorth wiſedome: but the tongue of the froward ſhalbe rooted out.

      * 32The lippes of the righteous wil ſpeake things pleaſaunt: but the mouth of the wicked ſpeaketh frowarde things.

      * 1FAlſe ballances are an abhomination vnto the Lord: but a perfect waight pleaſeth him.

      * 2When pride commeth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowlie is wiſedome.

      * 3The vprightneſſe of the iuſt ſhall guide them: but the frowardeneſſe of the tranſgreſſours ſhall deſtroy them.

      * 4Riches auaile not in the day of wrath: but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.

      * 5The righteouſneſſe of the vpright ſhall direct his waye: but the wicked ſhall fall in his owne wickedneſſe.

      * 6The righteouſneſſe of the iuſt ſhall deliuer them: but the tranſgreſſours ſhall bee taken in their owne wickedneſſe.

      * 7When a wicked man dyeth, his hope periſheth, & the hope of the vniuſt ſhal periſh.

      * 8The righteous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſteede.

      * 9An hypocrite with his mouth hurteth his neighbour: but the righteous ſhalbe deliuered by knowledge.

      * 10In the proſperitie of the righteous the Citie reioyceth: and when the wicked periſh, there is ioye.

      * 11By the bleſſing of the righteous, the Citie is exalted: but it is ſubuerted by the mouth of the wicked.

      * 12Hee that deſpiſeth his neighbour, is deſtitute of wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding wil keepe ſilence.

      * 13Hee that goeth about as a ſlaunderer, diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.

      * 14Where no counſel is, the people fal: but where many counſellers are, there is health.

      * 15He ſhalbe ſore vexed that is ſuretie for a ſtranger: and he that hateth ſuretieſhip, is ſure.

      * 16A gracious woman atteineth honour: and the ſtrong men attaine riches.

      * 17He that is merciful, rewardeth his owne ſoule: but hee that troubleth his owne fleſh, is cruel.

      * 18The wicked woorketh a diſceitful woorke: but hee that ſoweth righteouſneſſe, ſhall receyue a ſure rewarde.

      * 19As righteouſneſſe leadeth to life ſo hee that foloweth euil, ſeeketh his owne death.

      * 20They that are of a froward heart, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: but they that are vpright in theyr way, are his delight.

      * 21Though hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhal not goe vnpuniſhed: but the ſeede of the righteous ſhal eſcape.

      * 22As a iewel of golde in a Swines ſnout: ſo is a faire woman which lacketh diſcretion.

      * 23The deſire of the righteous is onely good: but the hope of the wicked is indignation.

      * 24There is that ſcattereth, and is more encreaſed: but he that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.

      * 25The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall alſo haue rayne.

      * 16Hee that withdraweth the corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall bee on the head of him that ſelleth corne.

      * 27He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill, it ſhall come to him.

      * 28He that truſteth in his riches, ſhall fall but the righteous ſhall floriſhe as a leafe.

      * 29Hee that troubleth his owne houſe, ſhall inherite the winde: and the foole ſhalbe ſeruant vnto the wiſe in hearte.

      * 30The fruite of the righteous is a tree of life: and hee that winneth ſoules, is wiſe.

      * 31Behold, the righteous ſhalbe recompenſed in the earth: howe much more the wicked and the ſinner?

      * 1He that loueth inſtruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole.

      * 2A good man getteth fauour of the Lorde: but the man of wicked imaginations, wil he condemne.

      * 3A man cannot be eſtabliſhed by wickednes: but the roote of the righteous ſhal not be mooued.

      * 4A vertuous woman is the crown of her husband: but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed, is a corruption in his bones.

      * 5The thoughts of the iuſt are right: but the counſels of the wicked, are deceitful.

      * 6The talking of the wicked, is to lie in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous wil deliuer them.

      * 7God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the houſe of the righteous ſhal ſtand.

      * 8A man ſhalbe commended for his wiſedome: but the froward of heart ſhalbe deſpiſed.

      * 9He that is deſpiſed, and is his owne ſeruant, is better then he that boaſteth himſelf & lacketh bread.

      * 10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt: bu• the mercies of the wicked are cruell.

      * 11Hee that tilleth his land, ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, is deſtitute of vnderſtanding.

      * 12The wicked deſireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite.

      * 13The euil man is ſnared by the wickedneſſe of his lippes: but the iuſt ſhal come out of aduerſitie.

      * 14A man ſhall be ſatiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth: and the recompence of a mans handes ſhall God giue vnto him.

      * 15The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but hee that heareth counſel, is wiſe.

      * 16A foole in a day ſhalbe knowne by his anger: but he that couereth ſhame, is wiſe.

      * 17Hee that ſpeaketh trueth, will ſhewe righteouſnes: but a falſe witneſſe vſeth diſceit.

      * 18There is that ſpeaketh wordes like the prickinges of a ſword: but the tongue of the wiſe man is health.

      * 19The lippe of trueth ſhalbee ſtable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently.

      * 20Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine euil: but to the counſellours of peace ſhalbe ioy.

      * 21There ſhall no iniquitie come to the iuſt: but the wicked are full of euill.

      * 22The lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lorde: but they that deale truely, are his delight.

      * 23Awiſe man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publiſheth fooliſhnes.

      * 24The hande of the diligent ſhalbeare rule: but the ydle ſhalbe vnder tribute.

      * 25Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good word reioyceth it.

      * 26The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked wil deceiue them.

      * 27The deceitful man roſteth not that he tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious.

      * 28Lyfe is in the way of righteouſnes: and in that pathway there is no death.

      * 1A wiſe ſonne wil obey the inſtruction of his father: but a ſcorner wil heare no rebuke.

      * 2A man ſhal eate good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the ſoule of the treſpaſſers ſhal ſuffer violence.

      * 3Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but hee that openeth his lippes, deſtruction ſhalbe to him.

      * 4The ſluggarde luſteth, but his ſoule hath naught: but the ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie.

      * 5A righteous man hateth lying woordes: but the wicked cauſeth ſlander and ſhame.

      * 6Righteouſneſſe preſerueth the vpright of life: but wickedneſſe ouerthroweth the ſinner.

      * 7There is that maketh himſelfe rich, and hath nothing, and that maketh himſelfe poore, hauing greate riches.

      * 8A man will giue his riches for the ranſome of his life: but the poore cannot heare the reproche.

      * 9The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 10Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the wel aduiſed, is wiſedome.

      * 11The riches of vanitie ſhal diminiſh: but hee that gathereth with the hand, ſhal increaſe them.

      * 12The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the deſire commeth, it is as a tree of life.

      * 13Hee that deſpiſeth the worde, ſhalbee deſtroyed: but he that feareth the commaundement, ſhalbee rewarded.

      * 14The inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as the wel ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death.

      * 15Good vnderſtanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the diſobedient is hated.

      * 16Euery wiſe man wil worke by knowledge: but a foole will ſpread abrode follie.

      * 17A wicked meſſenger falleth into euil: but a faythfull Ambaſſadour is preſeruation.

      * 18Pouertie & ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction: but he that regardeth correction, ſhalbe honored.

      * 23Much foode is in the field of the poore: but the field is deſtroyed without diſcretion.

      * 24He that ſpareth his rodde, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, chaſteneth him betimes.

      * 19The euil ſhal bowe before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the righteous.

      * 20The poore is hated euen of his owne neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.

      * 21The ſinner deſpiſeth his neighbour: but he that hath mercy on the poore, is bleſſed.

      * 22Doe not they erre that imagine euill? but to them that thinke on good thinges, ſhall bee mercy and trueth.

      * 23In all labour there is abundance: but the talke of the lippes bringeth onely want.

      * 24The crowne of the wiſe is their riches: and the follie of fooles is fooliſhneſſe.

      * 26In the feare of the Lorde is an aſſured ſtrength, and his children ſhall haue hope.

      * 27The feare of the Lorde is a wellſpring of life, to auoide the ſnares of death.

      * 28In the multitude of the people is the honour of a king: & for the want of people commeth the deſtruction of the Prince.

      * 29He that is ſlowe to wrath, is of great wiſedome: but he• that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.

      * 30A ſounde heart is the life of the fleſhe: but enuie is the rotting of the bones.

      * 31Hee that oppreſſeth the poore, reproueth him that made him but hee honoureth him that hath mercy on the poore.

      * 17Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then aſtalled oxe, and hatred therewith.

      * 18An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but he that is ſlowe to wrath, appeaſeth ſtriefe.

      * 19The way of a ſlouthful man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine.

      * 20A wiſe ſonne reioyceth the father: but a fooliſh man deſpiſeth his mother.

      * 21Fooliſhnes is ioy to him that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.

      * 22Without counſel thoughtes come to nought: but in tho multitude of counſellers there is ſtedfaſtneſſe.

      * 23A ioy commeth to a man by the anſwere of his mouth: and how good is a word in due ſeaſon?

      * 24The way of life is on high to the prudent, to auoyde from hell beneath.

      * 25The Lord wil deſtroy the houſe of the proude men: but he wil ſtabliſh the borders of the widow.

      * 26The thoughtes of the wicked are abhomination to the Lorde: but the pure haue pleaſant wordes.

      * 27He that is greedie of gaine, troubleth his owne houſe: but he that hate th giftes ſhal liue.

      * 28The heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwere: but the wicked mans mouth babbleth euil things.

      * 29The Lord is farre of from the wicked: but hee heareth the prayer of the righteous.

      * 30The light of the eyes reioyceth the hearte, and a good name maketh the bones fatte.

      * 31The eare that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, ſhall lodge among the wiſe.

      * 32Hee that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule: but hee that obeieth correction, getteth vnderſtanding.

      * 33The feare of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdome: and before honour goeth humilitie.

      * 1THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lorde.

      * 3Commit thy woorkes vnto the Lorde, and thy thoughtes ſhalbe directed.

      * 4The Lorde hath made al things for his owne ſake: yea, euen the wicked for the day of euill.

      * 5All that are proude of heart, are in abhomination to the Lorde: though hand ioyne in hande, hee ſhal not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6By mercie and truth iniquitie ſhalbe forgiuen: and by the feare of the Lorde they depart from euill.

      * 7When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make alſo his enemies at peace with him.

      * 8Better is a little with quietnes, then great reuenewes without equitie.

      * 9The heart of man purpoſeth his way: but the Lord doeth direct his ſteppes.

      * 10A diuine ſentence ſhalbe in the lippes of the King: his mouth ſhal not tranſgreſſe in iudgement.

      * 11A true waight and ballaunce are of the Lorde: all the waights of the bagge are his worke.

      * 12. It is abhomination vnto kinges to commit wickednes• for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iuſtice.

      * 13Righteous lippes are the delight of Kings, and the King loueth him that ſpeaketh right thinges.

      * 14The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death: but a wiſe man wil pacifie it.

      * 15In the light of the Kings countenance is life: & his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine.

      * 16Howe much better is it to get wiſedome then golde? and to get vnderſtanding, is more too bee deſired then ſiluer.

      * 17The path of the righteous is to decline from euill: and he keepeth his ſoule, that keepeth his way.

      * 18Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high minde before the fall.

      * 19Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to deuide the ſpoiles with the proude.

      * 20Hee that is wiſe in his buſineſſe, ſhall finde good: and hee that truſteth in the Lord, he is bleſſed.

      * 21The wiſe in heart ſhalbe called prudent: and the ſweetneſſe of the lippes ſhall increaſe doctrine.

      * 22Vnderſtanding is a well ſpring of life vnto them that haue it: and the inſtruction of fooles, is folly.

      * 23The heart of the wiſe guideth his mouth wiſely, and addeth doctrine to his lippes.

      * 24Fayre woordes are as an honie combe: ſweetenes to the ſoule, and health to the bones.

      * 25There is a way that ſeemeth right vnto man: but the yſſue thereof are the waies of death.

      * 26The perſon that trauelleth, trauelleth for himſelfe, for his mouth craueth it of him.

      * 27A wicked man diggeth vp euil, and in his lippes is like burning fire.

      * 28A froward perſon ſoweth ſtrife: and a taleteller maketh diuiſion among Princes.

      * 29A wicked man deceiueth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

      * 30He ſhutteth his eyes to deuiſe wickedneſſe, hee moueth his lippes, and bringeth euil to paſſe.

      * 31Age is a crowne of glory, when it is founde in the way of righteouſneſſe.

      * 32He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that ruleth his owne minde, is better then he that winneth a Citie.

      * 33The lot is caſt into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lorde.

      * 1BEtter is a dry morſel, if peace be with it, then an houſe ful of ſacrifices with ſtrife.

      * 2A diſcrete ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a lewde ſonne, and hee ſhall deuide the beritage among the brethren.

      * 3As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the fornace for golde: ſo the Lorde trieth the heartes.

      * 4The wicked giueth heede to falſe lippes: and a lyar hearkeneth to the naughtie tongue.

      * 5Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him: and he that reioyeeth at deſtruction, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.

      * 6Childrens children are the crowne of the elders: and the glorie of the children are their fathers.

      * 7High talke becommeth not a foole, much leſſe a lying talk a Prince.

      * 8A reward is as a ſtone pleaſant in the eyes of them that haue it: it proſpereth, whither ſoeuer it turneth.

      * 9Hee that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but hee that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth the Prince.

      * 10A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vnderſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.

      * 11A ſeditious perſon ſeeketh onely euil, and a cruel meſſenger ſhalbe ſent againſt him.

      * 12It is better for a man to meete a Beare robbed of her whelpes, then a foole in his follie.

      * 13Hee that rewardeth euil for good, euil ſhal not departe from his houſe.

      * 14The beginning of ſtrife is as one that openeth the waters: therefore ere the contention be medled with, leaue off.

      * 15Hee that iuſtifieth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the iuſt, euen they both are abhomination to the Lorde.

      * 16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wiſedome, and he hath no heart?

      * 17A freend loueth at al times, and a brother is borne for aduerſitie.

      * 18A man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, toucheth the hande, and becommeth ſuretie for his neighbour.

      * 19Hee loueth tranſgreſſion, that loueth ſtriefe: and hee that exalteth his gate, ſeeketh deſtruction.

      * 20The frowarde hearte findeth no good: and he that hath a naughtie tongue, ſhal fall into euill.

      * 21Hee that begetteth a foole, getteth himſelfe ſorowe: and the father of a foole can baue no ioy.

      * 22A ioyfull heart cauſeth good health: but a ſorowfull minde drieth the bones.

      * 23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the waies of iudgement.

      * 24Wiſedome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the worlde.

      * 25A fooliſhe ſonne is a griefe vnto his father, and a heauineſſe vnto her that bare him.

      * 26Surely it is not good to condemne the iuſt, nor that the Princes ſhoulde ſmite ſuch for equitie.

      * 27Hee that hath knowledge, ſpareth his woordes: and a man of vnderſtanding is of an excellent ſpirite.

      * 28Euen a foole when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and he that ſtoppeth his lippes, is prudent.

      * 1HE that is at libertie, ſeeketh freely, and ſtudieth euery doctrine, for the deſire thereof hee wil ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it, and occupie himſelfe in al wiſdome.

      * 2A foole hath no delight in vnderſtanding: but that his heart may be diſcouered.

      * 3When the wicked commeth, then commeth contempt, and with the vile man, reproche.

      * 4The woordes of a mans mouth are like deepe waters: and the well ſpring of wiſedome is like a flowing riuer.

      * 5It is not goood to accept the perſon of the wicked, to cauſe the righteous too fall in iudgement.

      * 6A fooles lippes come with ſtrife, and his mouth calleth for ſtripes.

      * 7A fooles mouth is his owne deſtruction, his lippes are a ſnare for his ſoule.

      * 8The wordes of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go downe into the bowels of the bellie.

      * 9He alſo that is ſlouthful in his worke, is euen the brother of him that is a great waſter.

      * 10The name of the Lorde is a ſtrong Tower: the righteous runneth vnto it, and is exalted.

      * 11The riche mans riches are his ſtrong Citie: and as an high wal in his imagination.

      * 12Before deſtruction the heart of man is hautie, & before glorie goeth lowlineſſe.

      * 13He that anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame vnto him.

      * 14The ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtaine his infirmitie: but a wounded ſpirite, who can beare it?

      * 15A wiſe hearte getteth knowledge, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.

      * 16A mans gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men.

      * 17He that is firſt in his owne cauſe, is iuſt: then commeth his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.

      * 18The lot cauſeth contentions to ceaſe, and maketh apartition among the mightie.

      * 19A brother offended is harder to winne then a ſtrong citie: and their contentions are like the barre of a palace.

      * 20With the fruite of a mans mouth ſhall his belly bee ſatisfied: and with the increaſe of his lippes ſhall he be filled.

      * 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that loue it, ſhal eate the fruite thereof.

      * 22Hee that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and draweth fauour from the Lorde.

      * 23The poore ſpeaketh with prayers: but the riche anſwereth roughly.

      * 24A man that hath friends, ought to ſhew himſelfe friendlie: for a friend is nearer then a brother.

      * 1BEtter is the poore man walking in his integritie of life, then he that abuſeth his lippes, and is a foole.

      * 2Deſire without diſcretion is not good: and he that haſteth with his feete, offendeth.

      * 3The fooliſhneſſe of man ſhal peruert his waye: And his hart ſhal fret againſt the Lorde.

      * 4Goods and riches gather freendes: but the poore man is ſeparated from his neighbour.

      * 5The falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, & he that telleth lyes ſhall not eſcape.

      * 6Many hang vpon the face of the Prince, and euerie one is a friend to him that giueth.

      * 7All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, and his freendes and fellowes withdrawe themſelues from him: Hee giueth credite to wordes, and getteth nothing.

      * 8Hee that hath a hart, loueth his ſoule, and keepeth prudence to finde riches.

      * 9The falſe witneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed: and hee that ſpeaketh lyes, ſhal periſh.

      * 10Pleaſures are not ſeemely for a foole: much leſſe for a bound man to haue rule ouer Princes.

      * 11The foreſight of a man maketh him defer his anger: and it is his honour to let faultes paſſe.

      * 12The kings diſpleaſure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his fauour is like the deawe vpon the graſſe?

      * 13The fooliſh childe is the fathers ſorowe: and a brawling wife is a continuall dropping.

      * 14Houſe and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a diſcreete woman is the gift of the Lord.

      * 15Slouthfulnes maketh one fal a ſleepe: and a ſoule accuſtomed to craft, ſhal ſuffer hunger.

      * 16Who ſo keepeth the Commandementes, keepeth his owne ſoule: but hee that regardeth not his wayes, ſhall dye.

      * 17Hee that hath pittie vppon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out, it ſhalbe paide him againe.

      * 18Chaſtiſe thy ſonne, while there is hope: and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his crying.

      * 19A man of great wrath ſhal ſuffer puniſhment: although thou once deliuer him, yet his anger wil come againe.

      * 20Giue eare vnto counſel, and take correction: that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in thy later dayes.

      * 21There are many thoughtes in the heart of man: but the counſel of the Lorde ſhal ſtand faſt.

      * 22That which is deſirable in a man, is his vpright dealing: inſomuch that the poore man is more profitable then the lyar.

      * 23The feare of the Lorde bringeth a man to life: And hee that it is filled with the ſame, lodgeth where no plague ſhall viſit him.

      * 24The ſlouthfull man hath ſhut his handes into his boſome: and will not take paine to put it to his mouth.

      * 25Smite the ſcornefull perſon, and the ignorant will take better heede: for if one reprooue the wiſe man, hee hath vnderſtanding to knowledge.

      * 26Hee that hurteth his father, or ſhutteth out his mother, is a ſhameful and an vnworthy ſonne.

      * 27My ſonne heare no more the doctrine that leadeth thee vnto errours, from the words of vnderſtandinge.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſcorneth iudgement: And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquitie.

      * 29Iudgementes are prepared for the ſcorneful, and ſtripes for fooles backes.

      * 1WIne is ſcornefull, and ſtrong drinke troubleſome: and who ſo erreth in the ſame, is not wiſe.

      * 2The feare of the king is as the roaring of a Lyon: he that prouoketh him to anger, offendeth agaynſt his owne ſoule.

      * 3It is a mans honour to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife: but euery foole will be medling.

      * 4The ſlouthful body wil not labour, becauſe of winter: therfore ſhall he begge in harueſt, and haue nothing.

      * 5Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe water: and a man of vnderſtanding will drawe it out.

      * 6The mightie man is named a well doer: but who ſhal finde a faithfull man?

      * 7Hee that walketh in his integritie, is iuſt: and his children ſhalbe happy after him.

      * 8A king which ſitteth in throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his looke.

      * 9Who ſhall ſay, I haue cleanſed my hearte: I am cleane from my ſinne?

      * 10Twoo manner of weighies, or twoo manner of meaſures, both theſe are abhomination vnto the Lorde.

      * 11The childs alſo ſhalbe knowne by his conuerſation, whether his workes be pure and right.

      * 12The Lorde hath made both theſe twoo: to wit, the eare, to heare; and the eye, to ſee.

      * 13Loue not ſleepe, leſt thou come into pouertie: but open thyne eyes that thou maiſt haue bread ynough.

      * 14It is naught, it is naught, ſaieth hee that buyeth: but withdrawing himſelfe aſide, he boaſteth of his bargaine.

      * 15There is golde and a multitude of ſtones: but the lippes of knowledge are a precious iewel.

      * 19Take his garment that is ſuretie for a ſtranger, and take a pledge of him for the vnknowne ſake.

      * 17A man thinketh the bread ſweet that is gotten with deceite: but afterwardes his mouth ſhalbe filled with grauel.

      * 18Confirme thy thoughts by counſel: and ſo make warre with wiſedome.

      * 19Hee that reuealeth ſecrete counſel, turneth to a backebyter: wherefore meddle not with him that offendeth with his lips.

      * 20The lampe of him that curſeth his father or mother, ſhalbe put out in the depth of darkeneſſe.

      * 21The heritage that is gotten in haſte, ſhal not be bleſſed in the ende.

      * 22Say not thou, I wil recompence euil, but put thy truſt in the Lord, and he ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23Diuers weights are an abhomination with the Lord, and falſe ballances are not good.

      * 24The ſteppes of man are in the handes of the Lord: how then ſhall a man knowe his owne waies?

      * 25It is a ruine for a man which deuoureth holineſſe: and after the vowe, to make enquirie.

      * 26A wiſe king diſpearſeth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele ouer them.

      * 27The lampe of the Lorde is the ſoule of man, ſearching all the inward partes of the belly.

      * 28Mercy and truthe ſhal preſerue the king, and with louing kindneſſe his ſeate ſhalbe eſtabliſhed.

      * 29The nobilitie of young men is their vertue: and a gray head, is the honour of the aged.

      * 30Bruſed woundes purge euill: and ſtripes in the inward partes of the body.

      * 1THE kinges hearte is in the hande of the Lorde: Like the riuers of water, ſo hee may turne it whither ſoeuer hee will.

      * 2Euery mans way ſeemeth right in his owne eies, but the Lorde pondereth the heart.

      * 3To doe iuſtice and iudgement, is more acceptable to the Lorde then ſacrifice.

      * 4An high looke, and a proude heart, which is the lanterne of the wicked, is ſinne.

      * 5The thoughts of the diligent, are onely vpon plenteouſnes: but he that is haſtie, commeth verily to pouertie.

      * 6To hoard vp riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanitie toſſed too and fro of them that ſeeke death.

      * 7The Rapines of the wicked ſhal deſtroye them: for they haue refuſed to doe iuſtice.

      * 8There is a man, whoſe waye is frowarde, and ſtrange: but the worke of the pure man is right.

      * 9It is better to dwell in a corner on the houſe toppe, then with a brauling woman in awide houſe.

      * 10The ſoule of the vngodly wiſheth euil, and his neighbour ſhal finde no fauour in his ſight.

      * 11When the ſcorneful is puniſhed, the ignorant taketh better heede: and when the wiſe is inſtructed, hee wil receiue vnderſtanding.

      * 12The iuſt man inſtructeth the houſe of the wicked: But for wickedneſſe, God ouerthroweth the vngodly.

      * 13Hee that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall crye himſelfe alſo, and not bee heard.

      * 14A priuie rewarde pacifieth diſpleaſure: And a gift in the boſome ſtilleth furiouſneſſe.

      * 15The iuſt man hath ioy to do iuſtice: but horror is to them that worke iniquitie.

      * 16The man that wandereth out of the way of wiſedome, ſhall remayne in the congregation of the dead.

      * 17The man that loueth banketting, is worthy of pouertie: and who ſo delighteth in wyne and delicates, ſhall not be riche.

      * 18The vngodly ſhalbe a ranſome for the righteous, and the wicked for the iuſt.

      * 19It is better to dwell in a wilderneſſe then with a chyding and an angrie woman.

      * 20In a wiſe mans houſe there is treaſure and oyle: but a fooliſh body will deuoure it.

      * 21Who ſo foloweth righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhal find life, righteouſneſſe and honour.

      * 22A wiſe man ſcaleth the Citie of the mighty, and ouerthroweth the ſtrength wherin they truſted.

      * 23Who ſo keepeth his mouth and his tongue, the ſame keepeth his ſoule from troubles.

      * 24He is called proude, arrogant, and ſcornful, which in his wrath worketh preſumptuouſly.

      * 25The deſire of the ſlouthful ſhal kil him: for his handes haue refuſed to labour.

      * 26He coueteth greedily al the day long, but the righteous giueth, and ſpareth not.

      * 27The ſacrifice of the wicked is abhomination, by howe much more they bring it with an euil wil.

      * 28The falſe witneſſe ſhal periſhe: but a man that heareth, ſhal ſtil ſpeake.

      * 29An vngodly man hardeneth his face, but the iuſt reformeth his owne way.

      * 30There is neither wiſedome nor vnderſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.

      * 31The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel: but the Lord giueth victorie.

      * A Good name is more too bee deſired then great riches: and a louing fauour more then ſiluer and golde.

      * 2The rich and poore meete together: the Lorde is the maker of themal.

      * 3A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hydeth himſelfe: But the fooliſh goe on ſtil, and are puniſhed.

      * 4The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of the Lorde are riches, honour, and life.

      * 5Thornes and ſnares are in the way of the frowarde: but who ſo keepeth his ſoule, will flee farre from them.

      * 6Teache a childe in the entrance of his way: for hee ſhall not leaue it when hee is olde.

      * 7The rich beareth rule ouer the poore, and hee that boroweth, ſhalbe ſeruant to the lender.

      * 8Hee that ſoweth wickedneſſe, ſhal reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger ſhal faile.

      * 9The good eye ſhalbe bleſſed, for he hath giuē of his bread to the poore.

      * 10Driue out the ſcornefull man, and debate ſhall goe out with him, yea variance and ſlaunder ſhal ceaſſe.

      * 11The king is his freende that loueth cleanneſſe of hearte: and it is for the grace of his lippes.

      * 12The eies of the Lorde haue regarde to knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the woordes of the tranſgreſſour.

      * 13The ſlouthful bodie ſaith, there is a Lion without: I ſhalbe ſlaine in the ſtreete.

      * 14The mouth of ſtrange women is as a deepe pit: he whom the Lord is angrie withal, falleth therein.

      * 15Fooliſhneſſe is in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction wil driue it away from him.

      * 15Who ſo doeth the poore man woong, to encreaſe his owne riches, and giueth to the riche, hee certainly goeth to pouertie.

      * 17Bowe downe thine eare, and heare the woordes of the wiſe: applye thy heart vnto my doctrine.

      * 18For it wil be a pleaſant thing, if thou keepe them in thy belly, and order them together in thy lippes.

      * 19That thou mayeſt put thy truſt in the Lorde: I haue giuen thee to vnderſtande to daye, euen to thee.

      * 20Haue not I written to thee, three times in counſels and learning?

      * 21To the end, to giue thee to know the aſſurāce of the words of trueth, to anſwere wordes of veritie to them that ſende to thee.

      * 22Polle not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: and oppreſſe not the afflicted at the gate.

      * 23For the Lord himſelfe wil deale in their cauſe: and take away the ſoule of them which doe polle them.

      * 24Accompanie not with an angrie wilfull man: and walke not with the furious.

      * 25Leaſt thou learne his wayes, and reociue hurte too thy ſoule.

      * 26Be not thou one them that giue their hande vpon pledge and are ſureties for debts.

      * 27Why wilt thou put thy ſelfe in this danger? for if thou haſt not wherewithal to pay, they wil take away thy bed from vnder thee.

      * 28Thou ſhalt not remooue the auncient land marke which thy fore elders haue ſet.

      * 29If thou haſt ſeene a man diligent in his buſineſſe: hee ſhall ſtande before kinges, and not among the ſimple people.

      * WHen thou ſhalt be ſet downe to eate with a great Lord, in conſidering, conſider that which ſhall be ſet before thee.

      * 2And thruſt the knife into thy throte, if thou bee Lorde ouer the ſoule.

      * 3Deſire not his delicates, for it is a meate of lies.

      * 4Striue not to bee riche, but ceaſſe from thine owne aduiſe.

      * 5Wilt thou caſt thy eyes vpon that, when it is nothing? For in beſtowing, it wil beſtowe wings vpon it ſelfe, like an Egle, and wil flye vp to the ſkies.

      * 6Eate not the meate with an euil eye, and couet not his delectable morſels.

      * 7For as if he had thought it in his ſtomake, he will ſaye to thee eate and drinke, but his hearte ſhall not bee with thee.

      * 8Thou ſhalt vomit out the morſel, which thou haſt eaten: and ſhalt looſe thy pleaſant wordes.

      * 9Whiſper not in the fooles eare, for he will deſpiſe the wiſedome of thy woordes.

      * 10Remoue not the ancient Lande marke: And enter not in the fieldes of orphans.

      * 11For the redeemer is ſtrong: And hee wil pleade their cauſe againſt thee.

      * 12Apply thy hart to vnderſtanding: and thy eares to words of knowledge.Eſa. 10. 2. 3.

      * 13Withdraw not correction from the childe: if thou beate him with a rod, he wil not dye.

      * 14Thou ſhalt beate him with a rod, and deliuer his ſoule from hell.

      * 15My ſonne, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhal reioyce, and I alſo.

      * 16And my reines ſhal leape for ioy, when thy lips ſpeake righteous things.

      * 17Let not thyne hart bee enuious againſt ſinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.

      * 18For ſurely there is an ende, and thyne hope ſhal not bee cut off.

      * 19O thou my ſonne, heare and bee wiſe, and guide thyne heart vprightly in the way.

      * 20Keepe not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of fleſh.

      * 21For the drunkard and the glutton ſhalbe poore: and the too much ſleeper ſhalbe clothed with rags.

      * 22Heare thy father which begot thee: and diſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe waxeth old.

      * 23Buy trueth, and ſel it not, wiſedome, inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.

      * 24The father of the righteous, in reioyſing, ſhalbee glad: and hee that hath begotten a wiſe childe, ſhall haue ioy of him.

      * 25Let thy father reioyce in thee, and thy mother: and ſhee that bare thee, be glad.

      * 26My ſonne, giue mee thine hearte, and let thine eies delight in my wayes.

      * 27For a whore is as a deepe ditch: and a ſtrange woman as a narowe pit.

      * 28Alſo ſhee lieth in waite as for a praye: and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſours amongeſt men.

      * 29To whome is woe? To whom is ſorowe? To whom is ſtrife? To whome is mourning? To whome are woundes without cauſe? and to whom is the redneſſe of the eyes.

      * 30Euen to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that goe and ſeeke mixture.

      * 31Regarde not thou the wine when it is red, and when it ſheweth his coulour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleaſantly.

      * 32In the ende thereof it will bite like a ſerpent: and hurte like a Cockatrice.

      * 33Thine eyes ſhal looke vpon ſtrange women, & thine heart ſhal ſpeake leude thinges.

      * 34And thou ſhalt be as hee that ſleepeth in the heart of the ſea, and as he which ſleepeth in the toppe of the Maſt.

      * 35Then ſhalt thou ſay, They haue ſtricken me, but I was not ſicke: They haue beaten mee, and I haue not felte it: when I ſhal awake, I wil put my ſelfe forth, and ſeeke it ſtil.

      * 1BE not thou enuious againſt euel men, neither deſire to be with them.

      * 2For their heart imagineth rauine, and their lippes ſpeake moleſtation.

      * 3The houſe ſhalbe built by wiſedome, and eſtabliſhed by prudence.4And by ſcience ſhal the chambers bee filled, with al riches precious, and pleaſant.

      * 5The wiſe man is mightie, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his vertue.

      * 6For thou ſhalt make warre by good aduiſe: and ſafegard is in the multitude of counſellours.

      * 7Wiſedome is haughtie to the foole: wherefore he ſhal not open his mouth at the gate.

      * 8They ſhal cal him an imaginer of miſchiefe, which thinketh to doe euil.

      * 9The thought of a fooliſh perſon is ſinne: and the mocker is in abhomination with men.

      * 10Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy vertue is feeble.

      * 11Deliuer them that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not preſerue them that are led to be ſlame?

      * 12If thou ſay, behold, wee knewe not of it: hee that pondereth the heartes, doeth not hee vnderſtande it? and hee that keepeth thy ſoule, knoweth hee it not? and will not hee alſo recompence euery one according to his workes?

      * 13My ſonne eate hony, for it is good: and the hony combe is ſweete to thy mouth.

      * 14So ſhall the knowledge of wiſedome bee vnto thy ſoule, if thou finde it? and there ſhalbe an end, and thine hope, ſhall not bee cut of.

      * 15Lay no wayte as a wicked man, againſt the houſe of the righteous: and ſpoyle not his reſting place.

      * 16For the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againes but the wicked fall into miſchiefe.

      * 17Bee not thou glad when thine enimie falleth: and let not thine heart reioyce, when he ſtumbleth.

      * 18Leaſt peraduenture the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turne his wrath from him.

      * 19Frequent not thy ſelfe with the malicious: neither bee enuious at the wicked.

      * 20For there ſhalbe no ende to the euill man: the light of the wicked ſhalbe put out.

      * 21My ſonne, feare the Lorde, and the King, and meddle not with them that are diſguiſed.

      * 22For their deſtruction ſhal riſe ſodeinly: and who knoweth the ruine of them both?

      * 23Alſo theſe thinges appertaine to the wiſe: It is not good to knowe any mans face in iudgements.

      * 24Hee that ſayeth to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude abhorre him.

      * 25But in them that rebuke him, hee ſhall haue pleaſure: and vppon them ſhall come the bleſſing of goodneſſe.

      * 26They ſhal kiſſe the lippes of him that anſwereth vpright wordes.

      * 27Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy thinges in the field which is thyne, and after builde thyne houſe.

      * 28Bee not a witneſſe without cauſe againſt thy neighbour: for wilt thou deceiue with thy lips?

      * 29Say not, I wil doe to him as he hath done to mee, I wil recompence euery one according to his worke.

      * 30I paſſed by the field of the ſlouthful, and by the vineyard of the man voide of heart.

      * 31And loe, it was al growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face therof, and the ſtone wal therof was broken downe.

      * 32Then I beheld, and conſidered it wel: I looked vpon it, & receaued inſtruction.

      * 33Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, and a little foulding of the handes to ſleepe.

      * 34So thy pouertie commeth walking on: And thy neceſſitie as an armed man.

      * 1THeſe alſo are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Iuda copied out.

      * 2The glorie of God is to conceale a word: but the Kings honour is to ſearch out a word.

      * 3The heauens in height, & the earth in deepeneſſe, & the kings heart can no man ſearche out.

      * 4Take the droſſefrom the ſiluer, and there ſhal proceede a veſſel for the finour.

      * 5Take away the wicked from before the king, & his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe.

      * 6Boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, and ſtande not in the place of great men.

      * 7For it is better that it be ſaide vnto thee, come vp hither: thē thou to be put lower in the preſence of the prince whom thine eyes haue ſeene.

      * 8Goe not foorth haſtily to ſtrife, leſt thou know not what to doe in the ende therof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to ſhame.

      * 9Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour, & reueale not the ſecret of an other man.

      * 10Leſt happily, he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame: and that thine infamie doe not ceaſe.

      * 11A worde ſpoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of ſiluer.

      * 12Hee that reprooueth the wiſe and the obedient eare: is as a golden earing, and an ornament of fine golde.

      * 13As the cold of ſnow in the time of harueſt, ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him: for hee refreſheth the ſoule of his maiſtreſſe.

      * 14He that boaſteth of falſe liberalitie, is lyke cloudes, and winde without raine.

      * 15A Prince is pacified by the ſtaying of anger: and a ſofte tongue breaketh the bones.

      * 16Haſt thou founde hony? Eate that is ſufficient for thee: leaſt thou be ouerful, and vomit it.

      * 17Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours houſe, leaſt he bee weary of thee, and hate thee.

      * 18A man that anſwereth againſt his neighbour as a falſe witneſſe, is like a hammer, a ſworde, and a ſharp arrowe.

      * 19Confidence in an vnfaithfull man in the time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a ſliding foote.

      * 20Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde ſeaſon, is like vineger powred vponor Alumme, or Sope.Nitre, or like him that ſingeth ſongues to an heauie hearte.

      * 21If hee that hateth thee, bee hungrie, giue him bread to eate, and if hee bee thir ſtie, giue him water to drinke.

      * 22For thou kindleſt coales vpon his head, and the Lord ſhal deliuer thee.

      * 23As the North winde driueth away the raine: ſo doeth an angrie countenance, the ſlaundering tongue.

      * 24It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.

      * 25As are the colde waters to a perſon fainting for drinke: ſo is good newes from a farre country.

      * 26A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled wel, and a corrupt ſpring.

      * 27It is not good to eate much hony: ſo to ſearch their owne glory, is not glory.

      * 28A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie that is broken downe, and without walles.

      * 1AS the ſnowe in the Sommer, and as the raine in the Harueſt are not meete: So is honour vnſeemely for a foole.

      * 2As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſeleſſe, ſhal not come.

      * 3As the whip is for the Horſe, & the bridle for the Aſſe: ſo is the rodde for the fooles backe.

      * 4Anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt thou alſo be like to him.

      * 5Anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe: leſt hee be wiſe in his owne conceit.

      * 6Hee that ſendeth a meſſage by the hande of a foole, is as hee that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.

      * 7Lift vp the legs of a lame man: ſo ſhalbe a ſentence in a fooles mouth.

      * 8As a precious ſtone cloſed vp in a heape of ſtones: ſo is hee which giueth glory to a foole.

      * 9As a thorne ſtanding vp in the hand of a drunkarde, ſo is a parable in the mouth of fooles.

      * 10The mightie man doeth al thinges by himſelfe: but the foole giueth wages, yea, he giueth wages to the tranſgreſſours.

      * 11The foole which beginneth his follie afreſhe, is lyke a Dogge returning to his owne vomit.

      * 12Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? more hope is of a foole then of him.

      * 13The ſlouthfull man ſaith, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the ſtreetes.

      * 14As the dore turneth vpon his henges, ſo doth the ſlouthfull man vpon his bed.

      * 15The ſlouthfull hideth his hand in his boſome, & it greeueth him to put it againe to his mouth:

      * 16The ſluggarde is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render a reaſon.

      * 17Hee that paſſeth by and medleth with the ſtrife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dogge by the eares.

      * 18As hee that faineth himſelfe mad, caſteth fire brandes, arrowes and mortall things:19So dealeth the deceitfull man with his freend, & ſaith, am not I in ſport?

      * 20Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer ſtrife ceaſſeth.

      * 21As the coale maketh burning coales, and wood a fire, ſo the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife.

      * 22The wordes of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.

      * 23As ſiluer droſſe ouer laide vpon a potſharde, ſo are burning lippes, and an euill hearte.

      * 24Hee that hateth, wil counterfaite with his lippes: but in his heart he layeth vp deceit.

      * 25Though he ſpeake fauorably, beleeue him not: for there are ſeuen abhominations in his heart.

      * 26Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof ſhall bee diſcouered in the congregation.

      * 27Hee that diggeth a pitt, ſhall fall therin: and hee that rolleth a ſtone, it ſhal returne vnto him.

      * 28A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth cauſeth contention.

      * 1BOaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrowe: for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth.

      * 2Let another man prayſe thee, & not thyne owne mouth: a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes.

      * 3A ſtone is heauie, and the ſand weightie: but a fooles wrath is heauier then them both.

      * 4Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging: but who can ſtand before enuie?

      * 5Open rebuke is better then ſecrete loue.

      * 6The woundes of a louer are faythful: but the kiſſes of an enemie are harde.

      * 7The perſon that is full, treadeth vnder feete an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule euery bitter thing is ſweete.

      * 8As a byrd that wandereth from her neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his owne place.

      * 9As the oyntment and perfume reioyce the heart: ſo doeth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſel.

      * 10Thine owne freende, and thy fathers freende forſake thou not: neither enter into thy brothers houſe in the day of thy calamitie: for better is a neighbour that is neere, than a brother farre off.

      * 11My ſonne, be wiſe, and reioyce mine hearte, that I may anſwere him that reprocheth mee.

      * 12A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe: but the fooliſh goe on ſtill, and receiue hurt.

      * 13Take his garment that is ſuertie for a ſtraunger, and a pledge of him for the ſtraunger.

      * 14A curſe ſhalbe imputed vnto him that prayſeth his freende with a loud voyce, riſing vp early in the morning.

      * 15A continuall dropping in the day of raine, and a contentious woman are a like.

      * 16He that hideth her, hideth the winde, and ſhee is as the Oyle in his right hande that vttereth it ſelfe.

      * 17Iron ſharpeneth yron: ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his freende.

      * 18Hee that keepeth the Fig tree, ſhal eate the fruit thereof: ſo hee that waiteth vpon his maiſter, ſhal come to honour.

      * 19As in water, face anſwereth to face: ſo the hart of man to man.

      * 20The graue and deſtruction can neuer be ful, ſo the eyes of man can neuer be ſatiſfied.

      * 21As is the fining pot for ſiluer, and the furnace for gold: ſo is euerie man according to his dignitie.

      * 22Though thou ſhouldeſt braye a foole in a Morter, among wheate brayed with a Peſtel, yet wil not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.

      * 23Be diligent to knowe the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to the heardes.

      * 24For riches remaine not alway, nor the crowne from generation, to generation.

      * 25The heye diſcouereth it ſelfe, and the graſſe appeareth, and the hearbes of the mountaines are gathered.

      * 26The Lambes are for thy clothing, & the Goates are the price of the field.

      * 27And let the milke of the Goates bee ſufficient for thy foode, for the foode of thy familie, and for the ſuſtenance of thy maydes.

      * 1The wicked flye, when none purſueth: but the righteous are bolde as a Lyon.

      * 2For the tranſgreſſion of the lande there are many Princes thereof: but by a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a realme likewiſe endureth long.

      * 3A poore man, if he oppreſſe the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.

      * 4They that forſake the lawe, prayſe the wicked: but they that keepe the lawe, are angrie with them.

      * 5Malicious men vnderſtande not iudgement: but they that ſeeke the Lorde, vnderſtand al thinges.

      * 6Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his waies, though he be rich.

      * 7Hee that keepeth the lawe is a childe of vnderſtanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, ſhameth his father.

      * 8Hee that increaſeth his riches by vſury, and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will giue almes vnto the poore.

      * 9He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhalbe abhominable.

      * 13Hee that cauſeth the righteous to goe aſtray by an euill way, ſhall fal into his owne pit, and the vpright ſhall inherite good things.

      * 11The rich man is wiſe in his own conceite: but the poore that hath vnderſtanding, can try him.

      * 12When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tryed.

      * 13Hee that hydeth his ſinnes, ſhall not proſper: but hee that confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.

      * 14Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his hearte, ſhall fall into euill.

      * 15As is a roaring Lion and a hungrie Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.

      * 16A Prince deſtitute of underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſour: but he that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal prolong his dayes.

      * 17A man that doeth violence againſt the blood of a perſon, ſhal fly vnto the graue, & they ſhal not ſtay him.

      * 18He that walketh vprightly, ſhalbe ſaued: but he that is froward in his wayes, ſhal once fal.

      * 19He that tilleth his land ſhalbe ſatisfied with bread: but he that foloweth the idle, ſhalbe filled with pouertie.

      * 20A faythfull man ſhall abound in bleſſings: and hee that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.

      * 21To haue reſpect of perſons, is not good: for ſuch a man for a peece of bread wil deale vnfaithfully.

      * 22A man with a wicked eie haſteth to riches, and knoweth not the pouertie that ſhall come vpon him.

      * 23Hee that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the length, then hee that flattereth with his tongue.

      * 24Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and ſaith, it is notranſgreſſion, is the companion of a man that deſtroyeth.

      * 25He that is of a proude heart, ſtirreth vp ſtrife: but hee that truſteth in the Lorde▪ ſhalbe fat.

      * 26Hee that truſteth in his owne hearte, is a foole: but hee that walketh in wiſedome, ſhall bee deliuered.

      * 27He that giueth vnto the poore, ſhall not want: but hee that hideth his eies, ſhall haue many curſes.

      * 28When the wicked ryſe vp, a man hideth himſelfe: but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe.

      * 1A Man that hardeneth his necke, when he is rebuked, ſhal ſodainely be deſtroyed, and cannot be cured.

      * 2When the righteous are in authoritie the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſighe.

      * 3A man that loueth wiſedome, reioyceth his father: but he that feedeth harlots, waſteth the ſubſtance.

      * 4A King by iudgement mainteineth the countrie: but a man receiuing giftes, deſtroyeth it.

      * 5A man that flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a nette for his ſteppes.

      * 6In the tranſgreſſion of an euil man is his ſnare: but the righteous doth ſing and reioyce.

      * 7The righteous knoweth the cauſe of the poore, but the wicked regardeth not knowledge.

      * 8Scornefull men bring a citie into a ſnare: but wiſe men turne away wrath.

      * 9If a wiſe man contende with a fooliſh man, ſomtimes the foole is angry, ſometimes hee laugheth, but there is no ſtay.

      * 10Bloodie men hate him that is vpright: but the iuſt hath care of his ſoule.

      * 11A foole powreth out al his minde: but a wiſe man keepeth it in till afterwardes.

      * 12Of a Prince that hearkeneth vnto lies, al his ſeruauntes are wicked.

      * 13The poore and the vſurer meete together, and the Lord lighteneth both their eies.

      * 14The king that iudgeth the poore in trueth, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for euer.

      * 15The rod and correction giue wiſedome: but a childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.

      * 16When the wicked are increaſed, tranſgreſſion encreaſeth: but the righteous ſhall ſee their fall.

      * 17Correct thy ſonne, & he will giue thee reſt, and will giue pleaſure to thy ſoule.

      * 18Where there is no viſion, the people decay: but hee that keepeth the lawe, is bleſſed.

      * 19A ſlaue wil not be chaſtized with wordes: though hee vnderſtand, yet he wil not anſwere.

      * 20Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matters? there is more hope of a foole, then of him.

      * 21Hee that delicately bringeth vp his ſeruaunt from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his ſonne.

      * 22An angrie man ſtirreth vp ſtrife: and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.

      * 23The pride of a man ſhall bring him low: but the humble in ſpirite ſhall enioy glory.

      * 24He that is partner with a theefe, hateth his owne ſoule: hee heareth curſing and declareth it not.

      * 25The feare of man bringeth a ſnare: but he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhalbe exalted.

      * 26Many doe ſeeke the face of the ruler: but euerie mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.

      * 27A wicked man is abhomination to the iuſt, & hee that is vpright in his way, abhomination to the wicked.

      * 1The prophecie which the man ſpake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.

      * 2Surely, I am more fooliſh then any man, and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me.

      * 3For I haue not learned wiſedome, nor attayned to the knowledge of the Saintes.

      * 4Who hath aſcended vp to heauen, and deſcended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fiſt? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath eſtabliſhed all the endes of the earth? What is his name, and what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?

      * 5Euery worde of God is pure: he is a ſhielde to thoſe, that truſt in him.

      * 6Put nothing vnto his wordes, leaſt he reprooue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.

      * 7Two things haue I requyred of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.

      * 8Remoue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue mee not pouertie, nor riches: feede mee with foode, meete for mine eſtate.

      * 9Leaſt I be ful, and denye thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.

      * 10Accuſe not a ſeruant vnto his maiſter, leaſt he curſe thee, when thou haſt offended.

      * 11There is a generation that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe their mother.

      * 12There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not waſhed from their filthyneſſe.

      * 13There is a generation, whoſe eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are lifted vp.

      * 14There is a generation, whoſe teethe are as ſwoordes, and their iawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.

      * 15The Horſeleach hath two daughters, which crye, giue, giue. There be three thinges that wil not be ſatisfied: yea foure, that ſay not, it is enough:16The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, and the fire that ſaieth not, it is enough.

      * 17The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the riuer picke it out, and the young Egles eate it.

      * 18There be three thinges hid from mee, yea foure, that I knowe not.19The way of an Eagle in the ayre, the waye of a Serpent vpon a ſtone, the way of a ſhip in the midſt of the ſea, and the way of a man with a mayde.20Such is the way alſo of an adulterous wcman: ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaieth, I haue not committed iniquitie.

      * 21For three thinges the earth is mooued: yea, for foure it can not ſuſtaine it ſelfe.22For a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole when hee is filled with meate,23For the hateful woman, when ſhee is maried, and for a handmayde that is heyre to hermaiſtreſſe.

      * 24There be foure ſmal things in the earth, yet they are wiſe, and ful of wiſedome:25The Piſmyres, a people not ſtrong, yet prepare they their meate in ſommer:26The Conies, a people not mightie, yet make they their houſes in the Rocke:27The Graſhopper hath no King, yet goe they foorth al by bandes:28The Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.

      * 29There be three things that order wel their going: yea, foure are comely in going.30A Lyon which is ſtrong among beaſts, and turneth not at the ſight of any,31A luſtie grayhounde, and a goate, and a king, againſt whome there is no riſing vp.

      * 32If thou haſt beene fooliſh in lifting thy ſelfe vp, and if thou haſt thought wickedly, lay thy hand vppon thy mouth.

      * 33When one churneth milke, hee bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his noſe, cauſeth blood to come out: ſo he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth ſtrife.

      * 1THE wordes of king Lemuell: the propheſie which his mother taught him.

      * 2What, my ſonne? and what, the ſonne of my wombe? and what, O ſonne of my vowe?

      * 3Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy waies, which is to deſtroy kings.

      * 4It is not for kinges, O Lemuel, it is not for kinges to drinke wine, nor for princes ſtrong drinke.

      * 5Leaſt hee drink, and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.

      * 6Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him, that is readie to periſhe, and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart.

      * 7That he may drink & forget his pouertie, and remember his miſerie no more.

      * 8Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cauſe of al the children of deſtruction.

      * 9Open thy mouth: iudge righteouſneſſe, and iudge the afflicted, and the poore.

      * 10Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman? for their price is different from pearles.

      * 11The hearte of her husbande truſteth in her, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile.

      * 12She will doe him good, and not euill al the dayes of her life.

      * 13She ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and laboureth cheerefully with her hande.

      * 14Shee is like the ſhippes of merchantes: ſhee bringeth her foode, from a farre.

      * 15And ſhee riſeth, whiles it is yet night: and giueth the portion to her houſholde, and the ordinary to her maides.

      * 16She conſidereth a field, & getteth it: and with the fruite of her handes ſhe planteth a vineyard.

      * 17She girdeth her loynes with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes.

      * 18Shee feeleth that her merchandiſe is good: her candle is not put out by night.

      * 19She putteth ont her handes to the wherle, & her hands handle the ſpindle.

      * 20Shee ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and putteth foorth her handes to the needie.

      * 21Shee feareth not the ſnowe for her familie: for al her familie is clothed with double garments.

      * 22She maketh herſelfe Carpets: fine linnen, and Purple is her garment.

      * 23Her husbande is knowne in the gates, when hee fitteth with the elders of the lande.

      * 24She maketh ſheetes, and ſelleth them, and giueth girdles vnto the merchant.

      * 25Strength and honour is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhe ſhal reioyce.

      * 26She openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.

      * 27She conſidereth the wayes of her houſholde, and eateth not the bread of ydleneſſe.

      * 28Her children riſe vp, and call her bleſſed: her huſbande alſo ſhal praiſe her.

      * 29Many daughters haue gotten wealth, but thou haſt ſurmounted them all.

      * 30Fauour is deceitful, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lorde, ſhee ſhalbee prayſed.

      * 31Giue her of the fruite of her handes, and let her owne workes praiſe her in the gates.
